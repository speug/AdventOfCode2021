# Advent Of Code 2021

Welcome to my repo for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)!
I'm working with Python for ease of input/output. I strive for good, readable
code and striving for some reasonable level of efficiency. I mostly use a functional style (I think?) but will not shirk away from doing [some OOP](day6/board.py) if the assignment lends itself to that.

Each day's code is stored in its own directory, and the scripts expect a file
called 'input' to be found in the same directory where the script is run from, which contains the corresponding input for that day.
